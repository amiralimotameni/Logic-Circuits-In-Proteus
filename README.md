## ðŸ“Œ1. Logic Circuit In Proteus
an electronic circuit used in computers to perform a logical operation on its two or more input signals. There are six basic circuits, the AND, NOT, NAND, OR, NOR, and exclusive OR circuits, which can be combined into more complex circuits.

## ðŸ“Œ2. Multiplexer 1 to 4
A 4-to-1 multiplexer takes 4 inputs and directs a single selected input to output. The selection of input is controlled by selection inputs. A 4-to-1 multiplexer consists of a 2-to-4 decoder and 4X2 AND-OR. This multiplexer however takes 4 8-bit bus as inputs and outputs a single 8-bit bus.

## ðŸ“Œ3. Decoder 2 to 4
A 2 to 4 decoder is a combinational logic circuit that takes two input lines, typically labeled A and B, and generates four output lines, usually labeled Y0, Y1, Y2, and Y3. The decoder analyzes the input combination and activates the corresponding output line.

## ðŸ“Œ4. Common Bus Circuit
The basic computer has eight registers, a memory unit, and a control unit . Paths must be provided to transfer information from one register to another and between memory and registers.

## ðŸ“Œ5. Computing Circuit Design
In theoretical computer science, a circuit is a model of computation in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates, each of which computes a function.
